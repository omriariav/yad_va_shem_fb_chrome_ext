Unofficial YADVASHEM Facebook Chrome Extension
=========================

Chrome extension that adds YAD VA SHEM DB search for each profile name. 

Chrome store link:

Functionality:
=========
The extension injects Magen David icon via js/content.js into each Facebook profile page. Click the icon sends to js/bg.js the profile name/id and if it had alternate name, the string.

If the profile page has alternate name (Old last name that wasn't localised over the years) - the extension open up a search in the YAD VA SHEM db. If the profile page don't have alternate name it just searches by the last name (after checking it with the graph fb user API).

I encourage you to add your related victim last name as an alternate name. 

Note:
===========
This extension is not affiliated with Facebook Inc or Yad Va Shem in any way. It just an idea I had to help commemorate the holocaust in a modern way.

It sure can be done better, feel free to use it and suggest improvements. You can hit me up on twitter: @omriariav or via email: omri.ariav at gmail dot com.
